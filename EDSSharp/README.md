EDSSharp
=============

A C# CanOpen EDS (Electronic Data Sheet) library, CLI convertor and GUI editor.

This application is designed to load/save/edit and create EDS/DCF/XDC file for CANopen and also to generate the object dictionary for CANopenNode (V1.3 and newer) to aid development of CANopenNode devices.

EDS (Electronic Data Sheet) files are text files that define CANopen devices.
DCF (Device Configuration File) files are text files that define configured CANopen devices.
XDD files are an XML version of EDS files.

EDS/DCF are fully defined in the DSP306 standard by the CANopen standards body: CiA.

The EDS editor on its own is useful without the CANopenNode specific export and, as of the 0.6-XDD-alpha version, the editor can also load/save XDD files.
The GUI also shows PDO mappings and can generate reports of multiple devices that are loaded into the software.

The core library can be used without the GUI to implement eds/xdd loading/saving and parsing etc in other projects.

Please consider this code experimental and beta quality.
It is a work in progress and is rapidly changing.

Every attempt has been made to comply with the relevant DSP306 and other standards and EDS files from multiple sources have been tested for loading/saving and as been (at times) validated for errors using EDS conformance tools.

[Available exporters' list can be found here](https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenEditor?tab=readme-ov-file#available-formats).

CLI usage
---------

Convert a project file to any supported exporter format:

```
EDSSharp --infile project.xdd --outfile map.md --type NetworkPDOReport
```

Export a project to CANopenNode v4 `.c`/`.h` sources plus a protobuf JSON
document in one call:

```
EDSSharp --export-project --infile device.eds --outdir ./out [--od BASENAME] [--odname PREFIX] [--json FILE.json] [--canopennode v4|legacy]
```

`--od BASENAME` only names the generated source files (`BASENAME.c`/`BASENAME.h`).
The symbols inside always use the `OD_` prefix (`OD_PERSIST_COMM`, `OD_CNT_*`, ...),
matching what the GUI produces when exporting to `OD.c`/`OD.h` and what
CANopenNode applications expect. Use `--odname PREFIX` to override the symbol
prefix, e.g. for linking several object dictionaries into one binary.

EDS custom extensions
---------------------

CANopenNode-specific object properties that plain EDS cannot express are
stored as `;Key=Value` comment lines (also understood by this parser):

- `;StorageLocation=RAM|PERSIST_COMM|...` — CANopenNode storage group
- `;CO_countLabel=NMT|EM|HB_PROD|SDO_SRV|RPDO|TPDO|...` — count label used to
  derive the `OD_CNT_*` counters of the CANopenNode v4 export. Without count
  labels the exported object dictionary has no counters and cannot be used to
  initialize the CANopenNode stack.

A complete demo network (three device nodes plus a monitoring master) built
with these extensions lives in [`../demo/`](../demo/).
